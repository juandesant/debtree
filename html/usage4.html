<p>
A reverse dependency graph shows why a package is installed: what other
packages depend on it.
</p><p>
This graph shows only installed packages (the <tt>-I</tt> option), with
the reverse dependencies in light blue. By default only one level of reverse
dependencies is displayed. In this example three levels are included as a
result of using the option <tt>--rdeps-depth=3</tt>. To show <i>only</i>
reverse dependencies, add the option <tt>--max-depth=0</tt>.
</p><p>
The colors of the arrows have the same meaning as for "forward" dependencies.
The inclusion of Recommends is controlled by the <tt>--no-recommends</tt>
option; displaying reverse dependencies of type Suggests is not supported.
</p><p>
The graph will always include all <i>direct</i> reverse dependencies
(both on the package itself and all virtual packages provided by it).
In the example some packages depend on <tt>apt</tt> itself, and others
on <tt>libapt-pkg-...</tt>.
</p><p>
As shown for <tt>debconf</tt>, the number of <i>indirect</i> reverse
dependencies that gets displayed, is by default limited to five, but that
can be changed by using the option <tt>--max_rdeps=<i>n</i></tt>. When
the individual packages are not shown, the number of packages per type of
dependency is shown next to their arrows.
</p><p>
It is possible to generate graphs that show all reverse dependencies,
both installed and not installed, but be warned that such graphs are
likely to explode in size.
