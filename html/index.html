<h1>debtree &mdash; package dependency graphs on steroids</h1>

<table>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This started with the simple question "how exactly does package X pull in
package Y when I install it". The only way I knew of was to use
<tt>aptitude</tt> interactively and just guess which package was the most
likely culprit.
</p><p>
So I set out to create a simple script to recurse through dependencies...
</p><p>
Basically this meant building a dependency tree. I'd long wanted to play
with <tt>dot</tt>, and this seemed like a good opportunity as visualizing
the trees looked like a nice way to check their correctness.
</p><p>
To make a long story short, after the basic functionality had been implemented,
it turned out to be fairly easy (and irresistible) to extend the functionality
bit by bit.
</p><p>
So now we have a script that can show dependency paths between packages and
can also generate dependency graphs in the form of <tt>.dot</tt> files that
serve as input for <tt>dot</tt> (from the <tt>graphviz</tt> package).
</p><p>
The command <tt>apt-cache</tt> already has a similar option, but
<tt>debtree</tt> is a lot more powerful.
</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>
The examples below show the different levels of detail that can be
obtained using <tt>debtree</tt> and explain the graphs. Please view
them in the indicated order.
</p><p>
Note that Postscript viewers may not display some of the larger graphs until
you zoom out one or more times. I've used <tt>kghostview</tt> and that at
least always showed the thumbnail correctly.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="debconf1.html">debconf</a></li>
<li><a href="aptitude1.html">aptitude</a></li>
<li><a href="usage1.html">advanced usage</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Other packages for which (mostly default) graphs have been produced, roughly
in ascending order of complexity:<br />
<tt>bind9</tt>, <tt>debmirror</tt>, <tt>gettext</tt>, <tt>iceweasel</tt>,
<tt>logcheck</tt>, <tt>logrotate</tt>, <tt>mutt</tt>, 
<tt>mysql-client</tt>, <tt>mysql-server</tt>, <tt>ssh</tt>, <tt>subversion</tt>,
<tt>debiandoc-sgml</tt>, <tt>exim4</tt>, <tt>cupsys</tt>, <tt>gimp</tt>,
<tt>lintian</tt>, <tt>apache2</tt>, <tt>wesnoth</tt>, <tt>vlc</tt>.
</p><p>
To get usable graphs for some of these, a number of packages have been added
to the <tt>/etc/debtree/endlist</tt> configuration file. If you try other
packages, you may need to do the same. Try to add only packages for which it
is "logical" not to expand the graph any further.
</p><p>
Another option is to limit the number of dependency levels (the "depth" of the
graph) by specifying a maximum depth or to reduce the amount of information
included in the graph using the available command line options.
</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>
The <tt>debtree</tt> script can be installed using this
<a href="debtree_0.8.0_all.deb">package</a>
(<a href="debtree_0.8.0.tar.gz">source</a>,
<a href="debtree_0.8.0.dsc" type="text/plain">.dsc</a>).
It is of course free software (GPL).
</p><p>
Its only dependency is <tt>dctrl-tools</tt>; <tt>graphviz</tt> is recommended.
</p><p>
You can also check out its git repository using:<br />
<tt><font size="-1">
$ git clone git://git.debian.org/~fjp/debtree.git
</font></tt>

</p>

<h2 id="issues">Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>
As <tt>debtree</tt> is currently written in <tt>bash</tt> and does individual
calls to the <tt>dctrl-tools</tt> utilities, it is not terribly fast. But then
again, it is not terribly slow either.
</li><li>
In some cases graphs can get fairly messy when there are alternatives that
have very similar dependencies. Good examples are <tt>apache</tt> and <tt>wesnoth</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future">Future development</h2>

<p>
There is still a lot of improvement possible. See also the comments in the
current script.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Re-implement in a decent language. C++ seems most logical as that is also used
in <tt>apt-cache</tt>, which could be used as a basis.<br />
As I don't have the skills needed to do this myself: volunteers are welcome!
</li><li>
Have the tool automatically determine points where to stop recursing or
where to create sub-graphs on a separate page.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>
See the <b>debtree</b>(1) man page for detailed usage information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul>

<p>
<b>Configuration</b>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>/etc/debtree/skiplist</tt></dt>
<dd>Packages that by default will be excluded from dependency graphs.</dd>
<dt><tt>/etc/debtree/endlist</tt></dt>
<dd>Packages for which by default no dependencies will be shown on graphs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
See the comments in these files and the examples on these pages for information
on how they are used. The configuration can be overruled on a per-user basis by
creating a directory <tt>~/.debtree/</tt> and adding custom versions of these
files there.
</p><p>
Suggestions for packages to add are welcome. Please mail both the command for the
graph you'd like to reduce and the packages you're proposing to add to the lists.
</p><p>
The current list of 'skip' packages is:<br />
<tt>libc6</tt>, <tt>libgcc1</tt>, <tt>libstdc++6</tt>, <tt>zlib1g</tt>,
<tt>libx11-6</tt>, <tt>libc6-dev</tt>, <tt>libc-dev</tt>.<br />
Reason these packages are excluded is that they are so common that including
them only result in cluttering the graph without adding any real information.
An option is available that allows to generate a full graph that includes
these packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tips</b>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>graphviz</tt> suite includes utilities that can be used to manipulate
graphs after they have been generated. See for example the man pages for
<tt>prune</tt> and <tt>gvpr</tt>.
