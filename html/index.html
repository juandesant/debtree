<h1>debtree &mdash; package dependency graphs on steroids</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This started with the simple question "how exactly does package X pull in
package Y when I install it". The only way I knew of was to use
<tt>aptitude</tt> interactively and just guess which package was the most
likely culprit.
</p><p>
So I set out to create a simple script to recurse through dependencies...
</p><p>
Basically this meant building a dependency tree. I'd long wanted to play
with <tt>dot</tt>, and this seemed like a good opportunity as visualizing
the trees looked like a nice way to check their correctness.
</p><p>
To make a long story short, after the basic functionality had been implemented,
it turned out to be fairly easy (and irresistible) to extend the functionality
bit by bit.
</p><p>
So now we have a script that can show dependency paths between packages and
can also generate dependency graphs in the form of <tt>.dot</tt> files that
serve as input for <tt>dot</tt> (from the <tt>graphviz</tt> package).
</p><p>
The command <tt>apt-cache</tt> already has a similar option, but
<tt>debtree</tt> is a lot more powerful.
</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>
The examples below show the different levels of detail that can be
obtained using <tt>debtree</tt> and explain the graphs. Please view
them in the indicated order.
</p><p>
Note that Postscript viewers may not display some of the larger graphs until
you zoom out one or more times. I've used <tt>kghostview</tt> and that at
least always showed the thumbnail correctly.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="debconf1.html">debconf</a></li>
<li><a href="aptitude1.html">aptitude</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Other packages for which (mostly default) graphs have been produced, roughly
in ascending order of complexity:<br />
<tt>bind9</tt>, <tt>debmirror</tt>, <tt>gettext</tt>, <tt>iceweasel</tt>,
<tt>logcheck</tt>, <tt>logrotate</tt>, <tt>mutt</tt>, 
<tt>mysql-client</tt>, <tt>mysql-server</tt>, <tt>ssh</tt>, <tt>subversion</tt>,
<tt>debiandoc-sgml</tt>, <tt>exim4</tt>, <tt>cupsys</tt>, <tt>gimp</tt>,
<tt>lintian</tt>, <tt>apache2</tt>, <tt>wesnoth</tt>, <tt>vlc</tt>.
</p><p>
To get usable graphs for some of these, a number of packages have been added
to the <tt>package_end</tt> list in the script. If you try other packages,
you may need to do the same. Try to add only packages for which it is "logical"
not to expand the graph any further.
</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>
The <tt>debtree</tt> script can be installed using a
<a href="debtree_0.5.0_all.deb">package</a> or
just <a href="debtree">downloaded</a>.
It is of course free software (GPL).
</p><p>
Its only dependency is <tt>dctrl-tools</tt>; <tt>graphviz</tt> is recommended.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>
As <tt>debtree</tt> is currently written in <tt>bash</tt> and does individual
calls to the <tt>dctrl-tools</tt> utilities, it is not terribly fast. But then
again, it is not terribly slow either.
</li><li>
If a package is part of two sets of alternatives, it can be included in a graph
twice without that being indicated.
</li><li>
In some cases graphs can get fairly messy when there are alternatives that
have very similar dependencies. Good examples are <tt>apache</tt> and <tt>wesnoth</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future">Future development</h2>

<p>
There is still a lot of improvement possible. See also the comments in the
current script.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Re-implement in a decent language. C++ seems most logical as that is also used
in <tt>apt-cache</tt>, which could be used as a basis.<br />
As I don't have the skills needed to do this myself: volunteers are welcome!
</li><li>
Have the tool automatically determine points where to stop recursing or
where to create sub-graphs on a separate page.
</li>
</ul>
