<p>
This example shows a basic build dependency graph for <tt>dpkg</tt>.
Alternatives and Suggests are suppressed by default and Recommends and Conflicts
have been suppressed using command line options. This graph represents what gets
installed on a buildd when <tt>dpkg</tt> is built.
</p><p>
The <tt>--show-all</tt> option could have been used to also show dependencies on
packages like <tt>libc6</tt>. In this case the resulting graph is still manageable.
</p><p>
In this case only Build-Depends are shown. If present, Build-Depends-Indep are
indicated by lines that are thinner and a bit lighter in color.
</p><p>
By default the graph is generated for the architecture on which it is generated.
In that case the "arch conditions" for the build dependency on <tt>libselinux1-dev</tt>
would not have been displayed. They are in this graph because of the <tt>arch-=all</tt>
option. If the graph had been generated on a system running hurd-i386, the
dependency on <tt>libselinux1-dev</tt> would not have been shown at all.
</p><p>
Note that if you generate a graph for an architecture other than your system's,
the dependency information for some packages may not be available. These packages
will get a reddish shade.
</p><p>
If you'd like to see what you need to install on your own system to build a
package, use the <tt>-I</tt> option. In that case alternatives will not be
automatically suppressed.
</p><p>
For a nice, though somewhat extreme, example of a graph showing architecture
dependencies, give this a try:
</p><p>
<tt><font size="-1">
$ debtree -b --arch=all --no-recommends --no-conflicts debian-installer
</font></tt>
