<li><a href="debconf1.html">Basic graph (only hard dependencies and conflicts)</a></li>

<li><a href="debconf5.html">Default graph (showing Recommends, alternatives and versions)</a></li>
<li><a href="debconf6.html">Default graph with Suggests</a></li>
<li><b>Default graph with Suggests and versioned Conflicts</b></li>
<li><a href="debconf8.html">Default graph (rotated)</a></li>
</ol>
<hr />

<p>
Note the nice relationships around <tt>whiptail</tt> etc. with again the
Suggests a single arrow, but the Conflicts and Provides showing the correct
individual relationships. Hmm, looks like maybe the <tt>whiptail-utf8</tt>
stuff could be dropped completely...
</p><p>
This graph could be extended even further.
The <tt>no-skip</tt> and <tt>show-all</tt> options can be used to also show
packages that by default are excluded or for which the dependencies are not
expanded. However, in a lot of cases this will only reduce the usability of
the graph. (Although in the case of debconf the result with
<tt>-S -VC --show-all</tt> is still quite nice.)
</p><p>
It is more likely that you'll want additional packages to be excluded or not
expanded. Currently this is only possible by changing the script, but that
should be improved in future versions.
