<p>
Note the nice relationships around <tt>whiptail</tt> etc. with again the
Suggests a single arrow, but the Conflicts and Provides showing the correct
individual relationships. Hmm, looks like maybe the <tt>whiptail-utf8</tt>
stuff could be dropped completely...
</p><p>
This graph could be extended even further.
The <tt>no-skip</tt> and <tt>show-all</tt> options can be used to also show
packages that by default are excluded or for which the dependencies are not
expanded. However, in a lot of cases this will only reduce the usability of
the graph. (Although in the case of debconf the result with
<tt>-S -VC --show-all</tt> is still quite nice.)
</p><p>
It is more likely that you'll want additional packages to be excluded or not
expanded because the graph is too big or complex. The contents of a graph can
be limited by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
including less information, for example by not showing recommended packages
or conflicts, or using the <tt>show-installed</tt> option;
</li><li>
limiting the depth of the graph (note that with limit lower than 3 or 4 the
result will probably not be very useful);
</li><li>
adding packages to one of the configuration files in <tt>/etc/debtree/</tt>;
</li><li>
some combination of these methods.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some packages, especially meta packages like <tt>kde</tt>, have such a large
number of dependencies that it is almost impossible to produce a useful graph.
