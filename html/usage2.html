<p>
Ever wonder what additional packages would be installed if you install some
new software? And maybe more importantly, what extra goodies are suggested
or how much could be avoided because dependencies are only recommended? This
example visualizes this for clamav.
</p><p>
Already installed packages are shaded light green. Not installed packages
have a white background. Virtual packages are also white; as they don't exist
they can't be installed after all, so you'll have to look at the package(s)
providing them. 
</p><p>
Note that for alternative dependencies that are already satisfied, only any
already installed packages will be displayed. If a dependency is not yet
satisfied all alternative packages will be shown.
