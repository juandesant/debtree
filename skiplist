# This file contains a list of 'skip' packages for debtree
# By default debtree will completely ignore 'skip' packages: they, and their
# dependencies will not be displayed on graphs.
#
# This file is ignored when debtree is used to search for dependency paths
# between two packages.
#
# This file can be overruled on a per-user basis by creating a custom file
# in ~/.debtree/.
# List one or more packages per line (separated by spaces or tabs).
# Comments after package names are allowed.
