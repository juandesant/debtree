ToDo list for debtree
---------------------
* the dependency path usage needs testing and possibly updates; concentrated
  on getting dependency graphs correct
* add "usage" function and --version and --help options
* this code really needs a testsuite as regressions are many and subtle;
  comparing the .dot output with expected should be trivial if a fixed
  status database is used
* rewrite in e.g. C++; existing 'apt-cache dotty' code can be used as
  staring point
* automatic limiting
* automatically split graphs over multiple subgraphs (which dot will place
  on separate pages)
* identify transitional packages
