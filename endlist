# This file contains a list of 'end' packages for debtree
# By default debtree will not display any dependencies of 'end' packages
# which helps to limit the size and complexity of dependency graphs.
#
# This file is ignored when debtree is used to search for dependency paths
# between two packages.
#
# Note: the intention is to eventually make debtree smart enough to
# automatically limit the size of graphs or to automtically create
# sub graphs, without the need for manually maintained lists.
#
# This file can be overruled on a per-user basis by creating a directory
# ~/.debtree/ and adding a custom version of this file there.
# List one or more packages per line (separated by spaces or tabs).
# Comments after package names are allowed.
