Description: package dependency graphs on steroids
 Very powerful and versatile tool for generating dependency graphs showing the
 relationships between .deb packages.
 .
 The graph is generated in the form of a .dot file that can be used as input
 for the utility 'dot' from the graphviz  package. What information is included
 in a graph can be varied using command line options.
 .
 Supported are: regular (forward) dependencies, reverse dependencies, showing
 installed packages, virtual packages, alternatives, and much more.
