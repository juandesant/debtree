Description: Show relationships between packages (.deb)
 debtree has two functions:
 * show the dependency path(s) between two packages
 * create a dependency graph for a package
 .
 In the first case it shows through which dependencies a package pulls in
 another package when it is installed.
 .
 In the second case it generates a dependency graph in the form of a .dot
 file that can be used as input for the utility 'dot' from the graphviz
 package. What information is included in a graph can be varied using
 command line options.
