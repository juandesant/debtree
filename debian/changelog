debtree (0.6.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add sanity check for presence of dctrl-tools scripts.
    Thanks to Maximilian Attems for the suggestion.
  * Add new option no-skip. This allows packages that by default are skipped
    (not included at all) to be shown as "end" packages.
  * Add new option show-all. This results in the full dependency tree to be
    generated. The dependencies for every package are expanded and no packages
    are skipped.
  * Add support for generating build dependency graphs. By default a graph for
    the current architecture is generated.
  * Mark unknown packages with a different color ('oldlace'). This can only
    be done for packages that are not part of an alternatives set; for those
    that are, a warning is printed.
  * For leaf pseudo packages we need to check if they were members of
    alternative dependencies to avoid stray nodes in a graph (seen with
    geneweb).
  * Introduce verbosity options and rationalize messages and error handling.
