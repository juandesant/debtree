debtree (0.8.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add support for showing reverse dependencies in graphs.

  [ Changes in unreleased version 0.7.3 - Sun, 06 Sep 2009 11:24:50 +0200 ]
  * debian/control: add Vcs-Git field.
  * Fix a few corner cases where provides and alternatives were not displayed
    correctly for skip or end packages. There's a minor change in the way
    alternatives containing skipped packages are displayed.
  * Extend endlist and update for lenny/squeeze.

  [ Changes in unreleased version 0.7.2 - Wed, 24 Oct 2007 16:23:34 +0200 ]
  * Fix informational message listing skipped packages.
  * Don't show packages that provide a pseudo package if they are in the skip
    list.
  * Show pseudo packages provided by the requested package in dependency
    graphs (not in build dependency graphs).
  * Show multiple providing packages for a virtual package if there are less
    than a certain number (default 3); dependencies for the providing packages
    are not shown.
  * Add common build dependencies to end list.
  * Add some development/packaging related packages to skip and end lists;
    prompted by build dep graph for asterisk.

  [ Changes in unreleased version 0.7.1 - Thu, 18 Oct 2007 15:41:11 +0200 ]
  * Print info message with skipped dependencies after generating graph.
  * Split ToDo items out of script into separate file.
  * Add man page.

  [ Changes in unreleased version 0.7.0 - Tue, 02 Oct 2007 19:24:38 +0200 ]
  * Don't print graph elements for unknown packages when showing dependency
    paths.
  * Move the 'skip' and 'end' lists to configuration files using ucf to
    manage them. The user can install overrides in ~/.debtree.
  * Add logging functions to unclutter script.
  * Add new option max-depth which makes it possible to reduce the size and
    complexity of a graph by maximizing the number of times debtree will
    recurse into the next level of dependencies.

  [ Changes in unreleased version 0.6.0 - Sun, 30 Sep 2007 14:58:37 +0200 ]
  * Add support for generating build dependency graphs. By default a graph for
    the current architecture is generated.
  * Add new option no-conflicts; useful for build dependency graphs.
  * Add new option no-skip. This allows packages that by default are skipped
    (not included at all) to be shown as "end" packages.
  * Add new option show-all. This results in the full dependency tree to be
    generated. The dependencies for every package are expanded and no packages
    are skipped.
  * Add new option show-installed. Installed packages are marked with a
    different color ('honeydew'). For satisfied alternative dependencies only
    installed alternative packages are installed.
  * Mark unknown packages with a different color ('oldlace'). This can only
    be done for packages that are not part of an alternatives set; for those
    that are, a warning is printed.
  * For leaf pseudo packages we need to check if they were members of
    alternative dependencies to avoid stray nodes in a graph (seen with
    geneweb).
  * Introduce verbosity options and rationalize messages and error handling.
  * Add sanity check for presence of dctrl-tools scripts.
    Thanks to Maximilian Attems for the suggestion.

  [ Changes in unreleased version 0.5.0 - Fri, 28 Sep 2007 06:28:30 +0200 ]
  * Initial unofficial release.
