  * Take the highest available version for source packages as well.

debtree (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take the highest available version for uninstalled packages instead of the
    lowest. Thanks to Thomas Wentzel for the report and patch. Closes: #554719. 
  * Add a few more X.Org-related packages to the end list.

debtree (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Selectively use AptPkg for build dependencies. AptPkg will return the
    correct build dependencies for the current or a selected architecture,
    but cannot return the architecture conditions themselves. Therefore use
    AptPkg for all cases except for ARCH=all. For that case continue to call
    out to apt-cache.
  * Add hurd-i386, kfreebsd-i386, kfreebsd-amd64 as valid architectures.
  * Make debtree work for any locale. Closes: #547388.

debtree (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix perl error if package has no dependencies at all.
  * Add gksu to the end list.

debtree (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change packaging to use the magic 'dh' command.
  * Upload to the Debian archive. Closes: #447158. Yay!

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.9.9 - Wed, 16 Sep 2009 13:35:58 +0200 ]
  * Complete conversion to perl by using libapt-pkg-perl instead of call-outs
    to dctrl-tools, except for getting build dependencies as libapt-pkg-perl
    does not expose architecture conditions (#546863).

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.9.0 - Mon, 14 Sep 2009 19:56:12 +0200 ]
  * Remove support for printing dependency paths. It only duplicates
    functionality offered better by 'aptitude why'.
  * First stage of conversion to perl. Script is now written in perl, but
    still calls out to external dctrl-tools to get dependency info.
  * Show other providers for any virtual packages provided by the requested
    package.
  * Show order of dependencies on virtual packages by numbering the arrows.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.8.1 - Sat, 12 Sep 2009 17:56:27 +0200 ]
  * Update script version and copyright in script.
  * Move git repository to collab-maint on alioth.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.8.0 - Sat, 12 Sep 2009 16:01:49 +0200 ]
  * Add support for showing reverse dependencies in graphs.
  * Fix incomplete display of skipped packages (only first was shown).

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.7.3 - Sun, 06 Sep 2009 11:24:50 +0200 ]
  * debian/control: add Vcs-Git field.
  * Fix a few corner cases where provides and alternatives were not displayed
    correctly for skip or end packages. There's a minor change in the way
    alternatives containing skipped packages are displayed.
  * Extend endlist and update for lenny/squeeze.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.7.2 - Wed, 24 Oct 2007 16:23:34 +0200 ]
  * Fix informational message listing skipped packages.
  * Don't show packages that provide a pseudo package if they are in the skip
    list.
  * Show pseudo packages provided by the requested package in dependency
    graphs (not in build dependency graphs).
  * Show multiple providing packages for a virtual package if there are less
    than a certain number (default 3); dependencies for the providing packages
    are not shown.
  * Add common build dependencies to end list.
  * Add some development/packaging related packages to skip and end lists;
    prompted by build dep graph for asterisk.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.7.1 - Thu, 18 Oct 2007 15:41:11 +0200 ]
  * Print info message with skipped dependencies after generating graph.
  * Split ToDo items out of script into separate file.
  * Add man page.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.7.0 - Tue, 02 Oct 2007 19:24:38 +0200 ]
  * Don't print graph elements for unknown packages when showing dependency
    paths.
  * Move the 'skip' and 'end' lists to configuration files using ucf to
    manage them. The user can install overrides in ~/.debtree.
  * Add logging functions to unclutter script.
  * Add new option max-depth which makes it possible to reduce the size and
    complexity of a graph by maximizing the number of times debtree will
    recurse into the next level of dependencies.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.6.0 - Sun, 30 Sep 2007 14:58:37 +0200 ]
  * Add support for generating build dependency graphs. By default a graph for
    the current architecture is generated.
  * Add new option no-conflicts; useful for build dependency graphs.
  * Add new option no-skip. This allows packages that by default are skipped
    (not included at all) to be shown as "end" packages.
  * Add new option show-all. This results in the full dependency tree to be
    generated. The dependencies for every package are expanded and no packages
    are skipped.
  * Add new option show-installed. Installed packages are marked with a
    different color ('honeydew'). For satisfied alternative dependencies only
    installed alternative packages are installed.
  * Mark unknown packages with a different color ('oldlace'). This can only
    be done for packages that are not part of an alternatives set; for those
    that are, a warning is printed.
  * For leaf pseudo packages we need to check if they were members of
    alternative dependencies to avoid stray nodes in a graph (seen with
    geneweb).
  * Introduce verbosity options and rationalize messages and error handling.
  * Add sanity check for presence of dctrl-tools scripts.
    Thanks to Maximilian Attems for the suggestion.

  [ Changes in unofficial release 0.5.0 - Fri, 28 Sep 2007 06:28:30 +0200 ]
  * Initial unofficial release.
