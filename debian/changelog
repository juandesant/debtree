debtree (0.6.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add sanity check for presence of dctrl-tools scripts.
    Thanks to Maximilian Attems for the suggestion.
  * Add new option no-skip. This allows packages that by default are skipped
    (not included at all) to be shown as "end" packages.
  * Add new option show-all. This results in the full dependency tree to be
    generated. The dependencies for every package are expanded and no packages
    are skipped.
  * For leaf pseudo packages we need to check if they were members of
    alternative dependencies to avoid stray nodes in a graph (seen with
    geneweb).
